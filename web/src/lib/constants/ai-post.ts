1/${goal === "engagement" ? "Let's talk about something important..." : "Here's what most people get wrong:"}

${tone === "casual" ? "Okay, so here's the thing —" : "Let's break this down:"}

${topic.split(" ").slice(0, 5).join(" ")} isn't just about ${topic.split(" ")[0]}. It's about the bigger picture.

2/${goal === "education" ? "The truth is:" : "Here's where it gets interesting:"}

Most people miss this because they're focused on the wrong thing.

The real key? Consistency + Strategy.

3/Quick story:

I used to think ${topic.split(" ")[0] || "it"} was just about luck.

Until I realized:

→ It's about showing up daily
→ It's about providing value
→ It's about building genuine connections

4/So if you're struggling with ${topic.split(" ")[0] || "this"}, remember:

You're not behind. You're just on your own timeline.

Keep going. 💪

5/${generateCTA(goal)}`;
  } else if (platform === "linkedin") {
    content = `${topic === topic.toUpperCase() ? topic : topic.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + topic.slice(1)}

Here's my perspective:

${tone === "professional" ? "After analyzing this topic extensively," : "I've been thinking about this a lot,"}

${goal === "education" ? "Here's what most people miss:" : "Here's the thing:"}

${topic.split(" ")[0]?.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + topic.split(" ")[0]?.slice(1)} is not just about the surface level.

It's about:

→ Understanding the fundamentals
→ Applying them consistently
→ Measuring what works

${goal === "sales" ? "Want to dive deeper? Link in bio 👇" : "What's your experience?"}

I'd love to hear your thoughts below.

${generateCTA(goal)}

#${topic.split(" ").join("").replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "")} #Growth #Success`;
  } else if (platform === "twitter") {
    content = `${topic.split(" ").slice(0, 4).join(" ")} 👇

${tone === "casual" ? "okay but seriously" : "Here's the truth"} — ${goal === "education" ? "most people get this wrong" : "nobody talks about this enough"}

let me explain 🧵

${topic.split(" ")[0] || "It"} starts with understanding the basics.

Then you apply it consistently.

Results follow.

Simple? Yes.
Easy? No.

${generateCTA(goal)}`;
  } else if (platform === "instagram") {
    content = `${topic} ✨

${goal === "engagement" ? "POV:" : "Here's something I wish I knew earlier:"}

${topic.split(" ").slice(0, 6).join(" ")}...

Save this for later 📌
${generateCTA(goal)}`;
  } else if (platform === "tiktok") {
    content = `🎬 TikTok Script: ${topic}

【HOOK - First 1-2 seconds】
${tone === "casual" ? "Okay wait," : "Stop scrolling if"} ${topic.split(" ").slice(0, 3).join(" ")}...
${goal === "engagement" ? "This changed everything" : "Here's what nobody tells you"}

【BODY - 15-45 seconds】
${topic.split(" ").slice(0, 5).join(" ")} isn't what you think...

Let me show you 👇

${goal === "education" ? "Step 1:" : "First,"} Understand the basics
${goal === "education" ? "Step 2:" : "Then,"} Apply consistently
${goal === "education" ? "Step 3:" : "Finally,"} Watch what happens

【CTA】
${generateCTA(goal)}
Follow for more ${goal === "education" ? "tips" : "content"}! 🚀`;
  } else {
    content = `${topic}

${tone === "professional" ? "Key points:" : "Here's the thing:"}

• ${topic.split(" ")[0] || "It"} matters more than you think
• Consistency is key
• Results take time

${generateCTA(goal)}`;

  return {
    content,
    hashtags: generateHashtags(topic),
